# Venture RISC-V
A Verilog implemented RISC-V processor named Venture.

Designed to implement the base RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set Version 2.1, outlined in [The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf). This implementation is not currently designed to have any kind of execution environment so the ECALL and EBREAK instructions are unsupported.
In order to test this project there I also created a [RISC-V Assembler](https://github.com/Derpanieux/RISC-V_Assembler) written in Rust.
